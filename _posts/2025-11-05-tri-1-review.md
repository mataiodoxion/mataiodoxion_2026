# A Retrospective


## What I Learned

Since the beginning of the year, I don't think I've gained that much knowledge. Really. The brunt of all the information and experience I gained was just trying to implement more complex things for this class. I generally find frontend development pretty boring, and so I tried to make it as interesting as possible by learning:
- Rust -> WASM -> JS
- Viz.js networks framework
- Flask (Python)
- A bit more web-based Rust

Aside from technical knowledge gained from the class, I've learned to be a bit more concise with my communication and I've gained a bit more experience simply interacting with people -- although there is a long way for me to go.


## Sprints

### Sprint 1

**Sprint 1** was just general tools setup. Since I was on Arch, I had to do a little more manual installations and tinkering to get it to work. Funnily enough, there's one specific gem `erb` which I have to install every time I try to run the server, which took a bit to discover. There really was not much to learn here, but I did write a blog on troubleshooting some common problems I saw while helping people [here](https://mataiodoxion.github.io/mataiodoxion_2026/common-problems-setup_IPYNB_2_/). I also happened to write some blogs here and an API lesson (which was mainly just a writeup).

### Sprint 2

**Sprint 2** was the teaching/learnign sprint of JS/Python fundamentals. There really wasn't much for me here, so I tried pursuing some more ambitious ideas, like the [Procedures Lab](https://github.com/the-remakers/procedures-lab) to teach some server development alongside the general fundamental knowledge. As I expected, this was pretty hard for everybody (as intended), and there was very little motivation to do it; it's really a testament to me need to learn some UX for their intended audiences.

### Sprint 3

In **Sprint 3** we wanted to build a microblogging website. Now, this turned out pretty poorly, which I attribute to use trying to ambitiously overextend and do too much at once. The product was just a bunch of text.

I did, however, have fun using WASM for a demo of breaking AES ECB which I deployed on the site. The way I tinkered to ge this working was writing a library in Rust, compiling it to WASM with JS compatibilities, hosting the raw source code on a GitHub pages site, then importing that as a module into a notebook on [OCS](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/digital-famine/microblog/decentralization/) which could be called and initialized via the built in JS APIs. I happened to get some questions/dicussions about this at N@TM though! I think this will be a pretty useful skill in the future, so that's great

I also wrote two lessons (blogs, really) on *decentralization* and *threat modeling*, which I found some enjoyment in. Aside from that, I mainly focused on gluing everything together and and working on the network graphs using the `viz.js` library.


## N@TM

N@TM went okay. I think really only a few people were interested in the content, but I was told that I talked passionately and I had some discussions about the topics I presented (WASM, decentralization, cryptography). I talked about WASM with a parent and explained how I decided to host the code to call, which was probably the most interesting part of the night actually.

I did unfortunately have to leave earlier than I wanted, but I'll still some projects were interesting.


## Next Project

The main points of improvement I'll be working on then would be UX and communication. Generally, our lessons were pretty dry and my writing is *really* dry comparatively. I'm also pretty bad at designing frontend pages and such (since I usually spend most of my time in systems programming), so I think next project I'll be working on that.

Given time, I'd probably make our activities more interactive and develop the WASM AES ECB cracking demo to by more outwardly interesting.

Other than that, I want to work on the systems side of our projects in the future, maybe with Rust WASM ^w^.


## What I Want To Learn Next

- More Rust
- Embedded programming (Rust or C++)
- LEAN (FP proof lang)
- ZKPs
- Cryptography (at a deeper level)


## Analytics

I've made (on my school account):
- 76 commits
- 6 issues
- 19 PRs
- +21804/-4376 LOC

On my other account, I haven't been working on my projects that much; I've actually been focusing on taking a Real Analysis course I found online via MIT OCW.
