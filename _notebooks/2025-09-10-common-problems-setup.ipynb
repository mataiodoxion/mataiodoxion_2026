I figured I could just build my own from a different Jekyll theme and only pull what I needed (which would require a bit tinkering because they aren't so compatible). I ended up using [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) with a dark theme. The notebooks tended to be incompatible with their front matters, but I fixed those by removing a few fields. \n",
